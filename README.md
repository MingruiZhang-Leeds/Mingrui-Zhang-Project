Chinese license plate recognition system-Mingrui Zhang
Chinese licence plate positioning, correction and end-to-end recognition software based on u-net, cv2 and cnn, in which unet and cv2 are used for licence plate positioning and correction, and cnn is used for licence plate recognition, unet and cnn are based on the keras implementation of tensorflow.
Environment: python:3.6, tensorflow:1.15.2, opencv: 4.1.0.25, keras: 2.3.1
Overall idea: 1. use u-net image segmentation to get binarised image, 2. then use cv2 for edge detection to get the coordinates of the number plate region, and correct the number plate graphic, 3. use convolutional neural network cnn for multi-label end-to-end recognition of number plate
Achievement effect: the shooting angle tilt, strong exposure or dim environment can be better recognition, and even some Baidu AI licence plate recognition failed to identify the picture can also be identified.
Note: If you want to directly identify a complete licence plate like the one in the picture below, please make sure that the size of the picture is less than or equal to 240 * 80, otherwise it will be considered that the picture contains the rest of the area to be located, and the recognition effect is not good.
If using GPUs for training, ensure that CUDA and cuDNN are properly installed and versions are compatible with TensorFlow 1.15.2.
Place the training dataset in the U-net_datasets/ directory, containing the train_image and train_label subdirectories. Ensure that the licence plate image and label image formats match.
Deployment Hardware Requirements CPU: Intel i5 or higher, Memory: at least 8GB RAM, GPU: NVIDIA GPU (optional for accelerated training), Hard Drive: at least 50GB free space
Deployment software requirements OS: Windows 10, macOS 10.14+, or Linux (Ubuntu 18.04+), Python: 3.6, required libraries: TensorFlow 1.15.2, Keras 2.3.1, OpenCV 4.1.0.25
Deployment steps: Ensure that all dependencies are properly installed on the target server or computer. Copy the codebase from the development environment to the target environment. This can be done via Git or by copying the files directly.
Notes: model files: make sure the paths of trained model files (such as unet.h5 and cnn.h5) are set correctly in the deployment environment. gpu support: if using GPU for inference or training, make sure that CUDA and cuDNN are properly installed and configured. logging and error handling: in the deployment environment, it is recommended to set up a logging and error handling mechanism in order to quickly identify and resolve issues.
